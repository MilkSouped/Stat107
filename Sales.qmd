**Scientific Question: What differentiates top-rated products from bottom-rated products across various categories, and what keywords in customer reviews signal positive sentiments?**

We begin by adding the tidyverse library for later uses.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Next we read in the product information into a dataframe and then combine all the review csvs into one single dataframe to later data clean.

```{r}
data <- read.csv('product_info.csv')
review_files <- list.files(pattern = "reviews_.*\\.csv")
review_data <- do.call(rbind, lapply(review_files, read.csv))

```
