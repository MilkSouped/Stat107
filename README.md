Project Overview
================
- **Group Name**: Sales Team
- **Group Members**: Ethan Chan, Alex Back, Darren Kuboyama
- **Scientific Question**: How do customer engagement metrics, sentiments, and feedback patterns relate to product performance and differentiate top-rated from bottom-rated products across categories?
- **Null Hypothesis**: Customer engagement metrics, such as sentiment scores and feedback patterns, do not significantly influence product ratings, and there are no meaningful differences between top-rated and bottom-rated products.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: Customer engagement metrics significantly influence product ratings, and there is a meaningful difference in performance between top-rated and bottom-rated products
- **Summary**: In this project, we assess our scientific question by analyzing a large dataset with approximately 8,500 products and 1 million reviews for them, filtering them to focus on just the "Top 3" and "Worst 3" products in each category. We use a series of scatterplots, bar plots, and a linear model to identify key trends between each of the metrics including ratings, loves counts, the number of reviews, feedback ratios, and sentiment scores across the "Top 3" and "Worst 3" products.  With this analysis, we were able to better understand how engagement metrics, sentiments, and feedback patterns can impact product performance and provide further insight as to whether ratings alone truly influence a product's quality.
